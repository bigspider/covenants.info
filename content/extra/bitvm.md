## Introduction

BitVM is an optimistic generalized computation protocol that can be deployed on bitcoin today.
It is equivalent to the [MATT](/proposals/matt) protocol, but with the need for covenants replaced
with both a reduced security assumption and a much increased complexity.


## Implementations

An [official implementation](https://github.com/BitVM/BitVM) is being developed in Rust.
