## Introduction

`OP_CAT` is a simple opcode that concatenates two byte strings together in Bitcoin Script.

Andrew Poelstra once wrote a two-part series of blog posts to showcase how the `OP_CAT` opcode can
in itself effectively enable covenants:

- [CAT and Schnorr tricks 1](https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/blog/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-i.html)
- [CAT and Schnorr tricks 2](https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/blog/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-ii.html)

It's important to clarify that this proposal doesn't aim to introduce covenants to Bitcoin. Instead,
it is focused on introducing an opcode that holds broad utility across various scenarios. The
potency of several covenant proposals increases substantially when they can be integrated with the
functionality provided by `CAT`.

As a side note, `OP_CAT` is also one of the opcodes that would be re-enabled as part of the [_Great
Script Restoration_](/extra/gsr) project.


## Specification

A BIP of the `OP_CAT` opcode is currently [in draft status on
GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1525).

An implementation on Bitcoin Inquisition [is also
available](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/39).
